/**
 * 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
 * Note:
 *
 * There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
 *
 * Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
